# Refactoring Verification Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing and verification approach for the App.tsx refactoring to ensure zero functionality loss and maintain code quality throughout the process.

## Pre-Refactoring Baseline

### 1. Functionality Audit
Before starting any refactoring, document current functionality:

#### Core Game Features Checklist
- [ ] Player creation and stats calculation
- [ ] Combat system (player vs enemies)
- [ ] Spell casting and tag system
- [ ] Item crafting and equipment
- [ ] Homestead management
- [ ] Settlement interactions
- [ ] Save/load functionality
- [ ] Navigation between views
- [ ] Modal system
- [ ] Status effects and turn management

#### Performance Baseline
- [ ] Initial load time
- [ ] Combat turn processing time
- [ ] View transition speed
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] Bundle size

### 2. Create Test Scenarios
Document specific test scenarios for each major feature:

#### Combat Test Scenarios
```typescript
// Example test scenarios to verify after each phase
const combatTestScenarios = [
  {
    name: "Basic spell casting",
    steps: [
      "Start combat with enemy",
      "Cast fireball spell",
      "Verify damage calculation",
      "Verify status effects applied",
      "Verify enemy defeat handling"
    ]
  },
  {
    name: "Tag system interactions",
    steps: [
      "Cast spell with conflicting tags",
      "Verify effective tags calculation",
      "Verify synergy bonuses applied",
      "Verify damage modifiers"
    ]
  }
];
```

## Phase-by-Phase Verification

### Phase 1 Verification (Core Systems)

#### After extracting game-core/state/GameState.ts
**Verification Steps:**
1. [ ] All state variables maintain same initial values
2. [ ] State updates trigger re-renders correctly
3. [ ] No memory leaks in state management
4. [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
5. [ ] All existing functionality works

**Test Commands:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run type-check
# Manual testing of state-dependent features
```

#### After extracting game-core/player/PlayerStats.ts
**Verification Steps:**
1. [ ] `calculateEffectiveStats` returns identical results
2. [ ] Equipment bonuses calculated correctly
3. [ ] Status effect modifiers applied properly
4. [ ] Player stat display unchanged
5. [ ] Combat damage calculations unchanged

**Verification Code:**
```typescript
// Create test to compare old vs new calculateEffectiveStats
const testPlayer = { /* test player data */ };
const oldStats = oldCalculateEffectiveStats(testPlayer);
const newStats = newCalculateEffectiveStats(testPlayer);
console.assert(JSON.stringify(oldStats) === JSON.stringify(newStats));
```

3. [ ] State preservation during navigation
4. [ ] Modal handling unchanged
5. [ ] Back button behavior same

#### After extracting game loop systems
**Verification Steps:**
1. [ ] Turn management identical
2. [ ] Enemy AI behavior unchanged
3. [ ] Status effect duration tracking
4. [ ] Combat flow preservation
5. [ ] Save/load functionality works

### Phase 4 Verification (UI Components)

#### After extracting UI components
**Verification Steps:**
1. [ ] All views render identically
2. [ ] Component props passed correctly
3. [ ] Event handlers work properly
4. [ ] Styling unchanged
5. [ ] Responsive behavior maintained

## Automated Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests for Extracted Functions
Create unit tests for each extracted function:

```typescript
// Example unit test structure
describe('game-core/combat/DamageCalculation', () => {
  describe('calculateDamage', () => {
    it('should calculate damage correctly with no modifiers', () => {
      const result = calculateDamage(10, 5, 2, 'normal', 0, 0);
      expect(result).toBe(13); // 10 + 5 - 2
    });
    
    it('should apply weakness modifier correctly', () => {
      const result = calculateDamage(10, 5, 2, 'weak', 0, 0);
      expect(result).toBe(19); // (10 + 5) * 1.5 - 2
    });
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Tests
Test interactions between extracted modules:

```typescript
describe('Combat Integration', () => {
  it('should handle complete combat turn correctly', () => {
    const gameState = createTestGameState();
    const player = createTestPlayer();
    const enemy = createTestEnemy();
    
    // Test complete combat flow
    const result = processCombatTurn(gameState, player, enemy, 'fireball');
    
    expect(result.enemy.hp).toBeLessThan(enemy.hp);
    expect(result.combatLog).toHaveLength(2); // Attack + damage log
  });
});
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Test complete user workflows:

```typescript
describe('E2E Game Flow', () => {
  it('should complete full combat encounter', () => {
    // Start from home screen
    // Navigate to combat
    // Cast spells
    // Win combat
    // Return to home
    // Verify rewards received
  });
});
```

## Performance Verification

### 1. Bundle Size Analysis
```bash
# Before refactoring
npm run build
npm run analyze

# After each phase
npm run build
npm run analyze
# Compare bundle sizes and chunk distribution
```

### 2. Runtime Performance
```typescript
// Performance monitoring
const performanceTests = {
  combatTurnTime: () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    processCombatTurn(/* params */);
    const end = performance.now();
    return end - start;
  },
  
  viewTransitionTime: () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    navigateToView('COMBAT');
    const end = performance.now();
    return end - start;
  }
};
```

### 3. Memory Usage
```typescript
// Memory leak detection
const memoryTests = {
  checkForLeaks: () => {
    const initialMemory = performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize;
    
    // Perform operations
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      createAndDestroyCombat();
    }
    
    // Force garbage collection if available
    if (window.gc) window.gc();
    
    const finalMemory = performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize;
    const memoryIncrease = finalMemory - initialMemory;
    
    expect(memoryIncrease).toBeLessThan(1000000); // 1MB threshold
  }
};
```

## Regression Testing Checklist
